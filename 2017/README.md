# AdventOfCode-2017

I wanted to learn **pyhton** by attempting to do the advent of code from [2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

### From the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) page:


*"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."*


### How to Run code

open terminal and call the directory of teh desired file, then run the command

> python name.py
