# AdventOfCode

I wanted to learn **JavaScript** by attempting to do the advent of code 

### From the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) page:


*"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."*


### How to Run code

open terminal and call the directory of the desired file, then run the command

> node file_name.js

OR

> python name.py
