# AdventOfCode-2018

I wanted to learn **Javascript** by attempting to do the advent of code from [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

### From the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) page:


*"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."*
